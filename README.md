Project 2: Redesign this Website!
# Self Critique:
The project was a good to work on since it gave us the opportunity to work  and change a website. I made some changes as to adding a new page for the links and moving some of the wording on the Calander page. I did work on css but I still need more practice on it, it is not my strong spot. At this point, I know how to add submit buttons and fields to write in with the help of the labs. I also have to work with javascript more since before this class, I was not that invloved with using it. 

# Critique of each group member's work:
Everybody in the group did a great job. One group member worked on changing the appreance of the Calendar page with moving the homework table above the Calander table, and working on css as well. Another member changed the color for the website, working on css also. Members  fixing the issues the instructor stated, adding javascript as well. Also fixing grammar,working on the testing script and fixing issues.
